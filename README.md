# Mission - baseball game

🛫 **functional requirements**

A game which requires a user to guess 3 numbers(between 1 and 9 for each number)

- 💥 A 'strike' occurs when one of the guessed numbers exactly matches the corresponding generated number.
- ⚾ A 'ball' is given when one of the guessed numbers appears in the generated number (the same number but in a different location).
- 🤷‍♂️ If none of the guessed numbers appear in the generated number, then it is 'nothing'. Based on these hints, guessing the number that matches the generated number results in a win and the game ends.
    - Ex) The generated number is 998:
        - The guessed number is 987: *1 Strike, 1 Ball*
        - The guessed number is 888: *1 Strike*
        - The guessed number is 123: *Nothing*

**The Step-By-Step list**

1. Computer generates a random number- Random sequence of three numbers, each number ranging from 1~9.
2. Recieve user input- User inputs their guess of the three numbers.
3. Evaluation guess- Compare the user’s guess to the generate number and determine the number of *strikes*, *ball*, and *nothing*.
4. Display evaluation- Display the feedback(*strike/ball/nothing*) to user
5. Repeat or end game- Repeat the game until the user gusses correctly or end the game if user had already gotten the guess right.

**Classes and organization**

- RandomNumberGenerator
    - Purpose: Generating random sequence of three numbers, each number ranging from 1~9
    - Instance variables:
        - number: represents the generated number
    - Methods:
        - generate_num(): generate a sequence of three random numbers each between 1~9 and assigns the value to ‘number’

- GameInterface
    - Purpose: Handles user input&output
    - Instance variables:
        - guess: represents user’s guess of numbers
    - Methods:
        - get_guess(): recieves user’s guess and store in ‘guess’
        - display_eval(NumStrikes, NumBall, NumNothing, Flag): displays evaluation of comparison on user’s guess
        - display_winmsg(): displays a win message, a congrats
    
- GameLogic
    - Purpose: Manages the game’s core logic; such as comparing user’s guesses to computer’s generated number
    - Instance variables:
        - Flag: shows if user’s guess matches the computer’s generated number(True) or not(False)
        - NumStrikes: stores the total # of *strikes*
        - NumBall: stores the total # of *ball*
        - NumNothing: stores the total # of *nothing*
    - Methods:
        - compare_num(guess, number): compares the user’s input, ‘guess’, to ‘number’ generated by the computer, then determines the number of *strikes, ball, or nothing*, along with whether or not user’s guess perfectly matches the generated number*.* Stores in instance variables afterwards.

- RepeatOrEnd:
    - Purpose: determine if game repeats or ends based on the evaluation if user’s guess matches the generated number
    - Instance variables:
        - FlagGame: shows if game needs to repeat to end(True) or game has already ended(False)
    - Methods:
        - isvalid(Flag): based on the condition of ‘Flag’, restart the game by broadcasting other classes to restart(if Flag=False) or end the game (if Flag=True)
